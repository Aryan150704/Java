● Operator Precedence
● Higher precedence operators are solved first.

Priority	Operators	Example

1	() (Parentheses)      |	 (2 + 3) * 4 → 20
2	++, -- (Unary)    	  |  ++a
3	*, /, %	              |  5 * 2 → 10
4	+ , -                 |  10 + 2 → 12
5	Relational <, >, == 	|  a > b
6	Logical `&&,	
7	Assignment =, += etc. |	a += 5
